## How the documentation is organized

- [Tutorials](./tutorials/index) contains lessons that take the reader through a series
  of steps to complete a project of some kind
- [Topic guides](./topic-guides/index) discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Reference guides](./reference-guides/index) contain technical reference
  material. They describe how this project works and how to use it but assume
  that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](./how-to-guides/index) are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how the application
  works.
