# salt-gnupg-rotate

Easily rotate gnupg encryption keys of fully or partially encrypted files. ðŸ§‚

## About

This project was created to help with the rotation of secret keys on saltstack
controllers. Like probably at least some of you I am bad at rotating encryption
keys due to the effort and time required. This tool is meant to make that task
quick and painless.

  context and current indentation

  block contents as well as the re-encrypted blocks for you to manually validate
  the changed before applying them
